The Event Processing Engine (EPE) is designed to ingest, transform, and route
high volumes of structured and semi-structured data in real time. It supports
a plugin architecture that allows developers to extend its functionality without
modifying the core runtime.

### Key Components

1. Ingestion Layer
   Responsible for consuming events from external systems such as message
   queues, databases, or HTTP endpoints. It performs lightweight validation and
   forwards events to the processing pipeline.

2. Processing Pipeline
   The pipeline executes a series of transformations on incoming events.
   Transformations may include mapping fields, filtering records, aggregating
   metrics, or enriching events with external data sources.

3. Routing Engine
   After processing, events are assigned to one or more output sinks based on
   user-defined routing rules. Supported sinks include Kafka topics, S3 buckets,
   webhooks, and custom adapters.
