# Sample Knowledge Base

This repository contains a minimal corpus of documents for testing chunking,
embedding generation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.

The documents represent different kinds of content:
- High-level technical summaries
- Developer-oriented explanations
- Articles with narrative or analytical structure
- Mixed content (prose + pseudo-code)

You can use this repository for:
1. Experimenting with embedding models
2. Testing token chunking pipelines
3. Building FAISS / SQLite vector indexes
4. Debugging retrieval quality
