Human-centered design begins with empathy. Before writing a single line of
code or sketching a prototype, product teams must deeply understand the people
they are designing for. This includes learning about users' goals, frustrations,
environment, and workflow.

A common misconception is that human-centered design means implementing every
feature users request. Instead, its purpose is to identify the underlying
problems and craft solutions that balance user needs with business constraints
and technical feasibility.

Rapid prototyping is essential. Low-fidelity wireframes, paper sketches, or
interactive mockups allow teams to test assumptions quickly. Early testing
reduces the risk of costly rework later in the development process.

Finally, iteration never ends. Even successful products grow outdated as user
expectations change. Continuous discovery and feedback loops ensure that products
remain relevant and deliver meaningful value.
