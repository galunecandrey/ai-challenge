Distributed systems introduce challenges that are not present in single-machine
applications. The most fundamental issue is the absence of a global clock. When
multiple systems operate in parallel, coordinating them becomes difficult because
each system has its own perception of time.

Network communication adds another layer of complexity. Messages can be delayed,
duplicated, or lost entirely. Fault tolerance mechanisms like retries, timeouts,
and idempotent operations help mitigate this but can never fully eliminate the
inherent uncertainty.

Consensus algorithms such as Paxos and Raft enable distributed systems to agree
on a shared state, but they are notoriously complex to implement. Even with
these algorithms, real-world deployments suffer from subtle bugs, misconfigured
timeouts, or network partitions.

Developers often underestimate the difficulty of debugging distributed systems.
A single error can cascade through multiple services, making root-cause analysis
slow and unpredictable.

These challenges explain why distributed system expertise remains a highly
valuable skill in the software industry.
