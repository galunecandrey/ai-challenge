Software architecture has evolved through several major phases over the past
five decades. Early applications were monolithic by necessity: computing
resources were limited, development tools were primitive, and distributed
systems were far too costly to implement.

As hardware improved and networking became more reliable, the industry shifted
toward multi-tier web architectures. Developers began separating backend logic,
presentation layers, and databases. This modularity enabled larger teams to
collaborate without stepping on each other's work.

The next major shift was toward service-oriented architecture, commonly known
as SOA. It introduced the idea that software systems could be decomposed into
loosely coupled services, each with a well-defined responsibility. Although SOA
was powerful, it often required heavyweight infrastructure.

Modern applications increasingly adopt microservices. These small, independently
deployable components allow fast iteration and horizontal scaling. However,
they also increase operational complexity, leading to the rise of observability
tools, distributed tracing, and container orchestration systems like Kubernetes.

Software architecture continues to evolve, influenced by hardware progress,
developer needs, and the increasing demand for global-scale applications.
